  - investigate secure cookie via Akka
	X guard against agent spoofing
		X keep a map agents: of (agentID  → ActorRef)
		X verify: for each TakeAction t, (t.id  → self.sender) elem agents
		X stop agents that violate the above invariant
	- show that the protocol guarantees authenticity and integrity:
		- from server to clientManager
		- from clientManager to server
		- from clientManager to agent
		X from agent to clientManager
	- protect against replay attacks from spoofed client managers? (perhaps overkill)
