EnMAS Punch List:

X modify transition function to return a List[(State, Int)]

X guard against 3rd actor hijacking the reply channel for agents
	X set replyChannel explicitly

X guard against agent spoofing
	X keep a map agents: of (agentID  → ActorRef)
	X verify: for each TakeAction t, t.id  → self.sender elem
	X kill agents that violate the above invariant

_ update design diagrams to reflect prototyped code

_ investigate & implement dynamic compilation and class loading
	- for agents
	- for models

_ make sure remote actors are run in untrusted (safe) mode
	- i.e. no "lifecycle" messages allowed
	- this is a configuration issue (akka.conf)

_ test
	- behavioral and unit tests with scalatest
	- check out the scala.testing.Benchmark trait.  Supposedly just implement run() and get perf data

_ expose ServerManager with Lift web framework
	_ server status, uptime
	_ approve/deny/remove hosts
	_ active POMDP server instances
		- status, uptime
		- hosts, agents
		- start/pause/stop server
		- download log snapshot

_ turn on encryption layer
	- host registration & persistent storage
	- RSA key generation
	- symmetric key encrypt / decrypt
