EnMAS Punch List:

_ Expose ServerManager with Lift web framework
	_ server status, uptime
	_ approve/deny/remove hosts
	_ active POMDP server instances
		- status, uptime
		- hosts, agents
		- start/pause/stop server
		- download log snapshot

X guard against 3rd actor hijacking the reply channel for agents
	X set replyChannel explicitly

X guard against agent spoofing
	X keep a map agents: of (agentID  → ActorRef)
	X verify: for each TakeAction t, t.id  → self.sender elem
	X kill agents that violate the above invariant

_ make sure remote actors are run in untrusted (safe) mode
	- i.e. no "lifecycle" messages allowed

_ Update design diagrams to reflect prototyped code

_ Document all methods in all classes and all type aliases

_ Test
	- behavioral and unit tests with scalatest
	- check out the scala.testing.Benchmark trait.  Supposedly just implement run() and get perf data

_ Turn on encryption layer
	- Host registration & persistent storage
	- RSA key generation
	- Symmetric key encrypt / decrypt
