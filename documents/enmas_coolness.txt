What's Cool about EnMAS?

1. It lets you get down to business
  - one interface to define a POSG/POMDP problem.  write your own or use one of the included sample problems.
  - one interface for agents
  - simple GUI for starting and managing experiment runs
  - designed from the ground up to be simple enough for students to use in coursework yet powerful enough for MAS research

2. It's configurable
  - API for custom (user-defined) graphics output
  - API for custom (user-defined) loggers

3. It's scalable
  - automatically utilizes multiple cores/CPUs
  - distributed architecture supports deployment on a single node, a cluster, a LAN, or the internet with minimal fuss

4. It's portable
  - runs anywhere the JVM does

5. It's a communication format!
  - rather human-readable
  - all the power of the Scala programming language
  - flexible syntax supports all POSGs
  - clever transtition function format means one source for planning, learning, and hybrid algorithms

6. It's easy to install
  - The only dependency is a recent JVM

7. It's open source!
